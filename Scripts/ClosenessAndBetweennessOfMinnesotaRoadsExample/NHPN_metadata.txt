  Description:

    Abstract: The National Highway Planning Network is a comprehensive network database of the nation's major highway system.  It consists of over 400,000 miles of the nation's highways comprised of Rural Arterials, Urban Principal Arterials and all National Highway System routes. The data set covers the 48 contiguous States plus the District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. The nominal scale of the data set is 1:100,000 with a maximal positional error of ±80 meters.

    Purpose: The primary purpose of this geospatial data set is to serve the FHWA needs in highway planning, policy analysis, visualization of the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) database and network modeling.  The NHPN is the digital source used for coding and publishing the FHWA approved National Highway System maps.

Data_Quality_Information:

  Logical_Consistency_Report: Topological relationships of node and link and uniqueness of entity IDs are verified by the computer algorithm developed under ArcGIS 9.0 environment.

  Completeness_Report: The National Highway System Designations for Intermodal connectors and terminals and The Strategic Highway Network (STRAHNET) connectors have been verified by FHWA  as of July 2005.  Any addition and modification to the National Highway System routes as reported to the FHWA by July 2005 is also included. Errors found on NHS have been checked and rectified.

  Positional_Accuracy:

    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:

      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: The original elements of the NHPN have been conflated to the 1:100,000 DLG-3 data set, which maintains a nominal accuracy of at least ±80 meters. Where new roads have been added which are not in the DLG-3 database, link alignments have been digitized or converted from digital sources acquired from state DOTs with a map scale of at least 1:100,000. Where State data source was not available, CENSUS TIGER/Line 2000 was used.

        Codeset_Domain:

          Codeset_Source: Federal Information Processing Standards

    Attribute:

      Attribute_Label: CTFIPS

      Attribute_Definition: 3 digit FIPS Code for the County the node is contained in. (County FIPS are identified uniquely within a given State using the three digit code and uniquely within the US by prefixing the two digit State FIPS code to create a 5 digit code).  Nodes that are a County Boundary node will have a value of 999 for the CTFIPS field.

        Codeset_Domain:

          Codeset_Source: Federal Information Processing Standards

    Attribute:

      Attribute_Label: LGURB

      Attribute_Definition: Three digit Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) Urbanized Area code for the Adjusted Urbanized Area in which the node lies.  A value of 0 indicates the node is outside any HPMS Adjusted Urbanized Areas.  Nodes that lie on the boundary of an Urbanized Area will have a LGURB value of zero.

      Attribute_Definition_Source: Highway Performance Monitoling System

      Attribute_Domain_Values:

        Codeset_Domain:

    Attribute:

      Attribute_Label: SMURB

      Attribute_Definition: 5 digit CENSUS Adjusted Small Urban Area code for cities under 50,000 population in year 2000.  A value of 0 indicates the node is outside any Adjusted Small Urban Area.  Nodes that lie on the boundary of a small urban area will have a SMURB value of zero.

      Attribute_Definition_Source: CENSUS

      Attribute_Domain_Values:

        Codeset_Domain:

    Attribute:

      Attribute_Label: BNDRY

      Attribute_Definition: The BNDRY Flag is used to identify nodes which lie on the boundary of logical polygons maintained within the NHPN. The values for BNDRY are additive and can be used to describe a node which lies on the border of more than one boundary.  For example a node at a State border will also be a county border node and will therefore, have a value of 1 + 10 = 11.  Similarly, a node which lies on the boundary of an Urbanized Area and a small urban area will have a BNDRY value of 4 + 2 = 6.  If it were also a county boundary it would have a value of 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.
